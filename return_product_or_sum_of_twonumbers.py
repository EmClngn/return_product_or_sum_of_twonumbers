# Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000. Otherwise, return their sum.


# Psuedo Code


# Ask user input for 2 numbers
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Get the product of the two numbers
product = first_number * second_number
print(product)

# Add the sum of two numbers
sum = first_number + second_number
print(sum)
# Write it so that you'll return the product of the two numbers if equal to or lower than 1000 otherwise return their sum
